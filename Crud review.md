Sure, I'm glad to summarize what we've done, including the folder structure of your application. 

1. **Set Up Your Database:** You created a database using MySQL, making sure to include tables for your Products, Tags, and Categories. You also ensured to create a table for Product Tags to establish the many-to-many relationship between Products and Tags.

2. **Seed Your Database:** You created and ran a script to seed your database with initial data. This step involved creating JavaScript files that defined the initial entries for each table in your database, then using Sequelize's `bulkCreate` method to add these entries to your database.

3. **Set Up Your Models:** You used Sequelize to define models for each table in your database. This involved creating a file for each model and defining the attributes of each model to match the columns of your database tables. Additionally, you defined associations between your models to reflect the relationships between your tables in the database.

4. **Create Your API Routes:** You created Express.js routes for each of your models. This involved creating `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes to handle fetching, creating, updating, and deleting entries in your database. 

Here's a simplified look at what your folder structure might look like:

```
/ - Project root
|-- /config
|   |-- connection.js - Sets up your connection to your MySQL database using Sequelize
|-- /db
|   |-- /seeds - Contains scripts to seed your database
|   |-- schema.sql - SQL script to create your initial database
|-- /models - Contains your Sequelize models
|   |-- Product.js
|   |-- Tag.js
|   |-- Category.js
|   |-- ProductTag.js
|   |-- index.js - Contains associations between your models
|-- /routes - Contains your Express.js API routes
|   |-- /api - Contains API routes for each of your models
|   |   |-- product-routes.js
|   |   |-- category-routes.js
|   |   |-- tag-routes.js
|   |-- index.js - Combines all your API routes together
|-- /scripts
|   |-- seed.js - Script to seed your database using your Sequelize models
|-- server.js - The entry point to your application, sets up your Express.js server
|-- package.json - Defines the packages your project depends on
```

Remember, while this structure works well for this project, the actual structure of your project may vary depending on its specific needs. But it is generally good to keep things organized in a logical and consistent way, grouping related files together in directories. This will make your project easier to understand and maintain as it grows in complexity. 

I hope this helps! Please feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.
